The averages are computed based on all units counted towards satisfaction of degree requirements, excluding electives that are neither COMP courses nor courses that are listed within the degree's named specializations.

We denote these averages: A1, A2, A3, and A4 respectively. The averages are computed based on all units counted towards satisfaction of degree requirements, excluding electives that are neither COMP courses nor courses that are listed within the degree's named specialisations. Finally these averages are combined using the formula APM = (0.1 X A1) + (0.2 X A2) + (0.3 X A3) + (0.4 X A4)."
